## Example usage of CLoudEvents sdk/Reqwest from WASM

Install the dependencies with:

    npm install

Then build the example locally with:

    npm run serve

and then visiting http://localhost:8080 in a browser should run the example!

This example is loosely based off of [this example](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen/blob/master/examples/fetch/src/lib.rs), an example usage of `fetch` from `wasm-bindgen`, and from [reqwest repo](https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/tree/master/examples/wasm_github_fetch).
