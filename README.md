## Community

- There are bi-weekly calls immediately following the
  [Serverless/CloudEvents call](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec#meeting-time)
  at 9am PT (US Pacific). Which means they will typically start at 10am PT, but
  if the other call ends early then the SDK call will start early as well. See
  the
  [CloudEvents meeting minutes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OVF68rpuPK5shIHILK9JOqlZBbfe91RNzQ7u_P7YCDE/edit#)
  to determine which week will have the call.
